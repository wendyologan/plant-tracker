# 🌱 Plant Keeper

**Live Demo**: [View the Plant Keeper](https://yourusername.github.io/plant-tracker/)

## 📖 **About the Project**
Plant Keeper is a simple and interactive web app that allows users to track their beloved houseplants. With this app, users can add plants, edit details, and keep track of their status. Plants that "pass away" can be moved to the **Plant Graveyard**, giving them a proper digital send-off.

This project showcases my skills in **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **local storage persistence** to ensure users' data is saved even after refreshing the page.
